aCGI is no-standard but just a quick support for 'Server side Scripting' in this Web Server till I add Standard Support.

Currently it does nothing great, except seperating all GET Variables sent to Server; and provide it to Server-Side Script or Binary as different parameters.

Example:
for a request like 
http://www.WEBSITE.com/a-cgi/post.py?name=abk&project=sitehoster
it passes all GET Variables to 'post.py' as
cmd:\>python post.py name=abk project=sitehoster

To implement:
[] all Scripts should be place in any location under $DocumentRoot/a-cgi/*
[] and similar to CGI should have first line referring to its interpreter
as
-----start-of-script-----
line1:	#!python
line2:	...anything at all in rest of lines
-----end--of--script-----
[] you can even place Binaries in location $DocumentRoot/a-cgi/bin/*

a live example of it as working can be seen in XSS PoC provided
